# Part 3: Build a CRUD App

## Summary
In Part 3 of the assessment, we'll demonstrate our proficiency in building Sinatra applications: user authentication, associations, validations, controllers, views, etc. Even a little bit of CSS.

### Site Overview
We'll be building a simplified version of a blind auction siteâ€”in a blind auction, bidders do not see how much other bidders have bid.

The required functionality of the site will be described in more detail in the *Releases* section, but here's a basic overview.

**All Users**
- Browse available items.

**Unregistered Users**
- Register a new account.

**Registered Users**
- Sign in and out.
- List new items.
- Place bids on items.
- Have a profile showing their listing and bidding activity.

### Completing the App
Complete as much of this CRUD app as possible in the time allowed.  If time is running out and it looks like the app will not be completed, continue to work through the releases in order and complete as much as possible. Be sure to ask questions, if you find yourself stuck.

## Releases
### Pre-release:  Setup
We'll need to make sure that everything is set up before we begin working on the application.  From the command line, navigate to the `part-3` directory of the phase 2 assessment.  Once there, run ...

0. `$ bundle`
0. `$ bundle exec rake db:create`

### Release 0: User Registration
Users will need to register for a new account. Create a link on the home page that will take them to a page where they can enter their desired username and password. There are a two constraints to this feature:

1. The username must be unique
1. The password must be at least 6 characters long

If both constraints are met, the user should be considered logged in and redirected to the home page where all references to "Register" removed.

If either constraint is not met, the user should see the registration form and the associated error messages.

### Release 1: Login/Logout
#### Login
Given there is a previously registered user and they are not currently logged in:

On the home page, create a link to login.
When a user clicks on this link they should be taken to a page with a form to enter their credentials.

If the credentials match, the user should be taken back to the homepage and the login link should be replaced with a logout link.

If the credentials do not match, the user should see the login form and an error message stating the credentials were not valid.

#### Logout
Given there is a previously registered user and they are currently logged in:

On the home page create a link to logout.
When the user clicks on the logout link they should be taken to the home page and the links "Register" and "Login" should both be visible.

### Release 2: CRUD'ing a Resorouce
The user's profile page is where users are able to manage their listed items. We'll start off by giving them the ability to add an item and then work through the remaining CRUD actions.

#### Creating Items
Given the registered user is signed in:

On the home page create a link to the user's profile page.
When the user clicks on the profile link they should be taken to their profile page.

Create a link on this page to add an item to the auction site. The item should include things like a name and/or title, description, when the user would like the auction to start and when it should stop.

  *Note*: When creating and or editing an item, you'll need to create forms that allow you to enter dates. The HTML5 datetime input type is tricky to use with ActiveRecord. Consider using something like `<input type="text" name="my-date">` in the markup. When filling in the field, use the `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format (e.g. 2015-04-01 14:30:00).

After submitting an item the user should be back on their profile page.

#### Reading Items
Given the registered user is signed in and has previously created multiple items:

Create a section on the profile page to display all the items. This section should not include the long form description of the item.

#### Updating Items
Given the registered user is signed in and has previously created multiple items:

On the profile page, create an edit link associated to each of the items the user has created. This link should only be visible if the user logged in is the user that created the item.

When the user clicks the edit link associated to the item, they should be taken to a page to edit that item's details. After submitting this information the user should be taken back to their profile page and see the item's updates should be reflected on the page.

#### Deleting Items
Given the registered user is signed in and has previously created multiple items:

On the profile page, create a delete link associated to each of the items the user has created. Just like in the update section, this link should only be visible if the user logged in is the user that created the item.

When the user clicks the delete link, the user profile page should reload and the item should no longer be visible.

### Release 3: Bidding
Up until now, the home page has largely just contained links to allow the user to register or login, or if they were logged in, to logout. Now that users have the ability to create items for others to bid on, let's start filling in the homepage.

#### Viewing Active Items
Given there are multiple items previously created and at least a few of the items are currently active:

Create a section on the home page to list the items that are currently available and active. To clarify, active means the items have start date on or before today and the end date is on or after today.

#### Creating a Bid
Given there are multiple items previously created, at least a few of the items are currently active, and the registered user is signed in:

Make the name or title of the listed items in the home page a link. When the user clicks on a link for an item, they should be on a page that is displaying the details of the item. This will include the long form description and add a section on the page to display the current number of bidders.

Add a form to the item detail page that will allow the user to enter a bid amount. The submit button for the form should say "Place Bid".

When the user submits the bidding form, the page should reload. Where the form was located, there should be the text "Thank you for your bid. Good luck!" and the number of bidders section should be incremented by 1.

#### Login or Register to Bid
Given the current user is not logged in and the user is on the item details page for a previously created item.

In place of the bidding form, a user should see the text "To place a bid please login or register." Both login and register should be links taking the user to their respective pages.

### Release 4: Bid on Items on the Profile Page
Now that we can bid on items, let's make it easy to keep track of the things we have bid on.

#### Bid on Items
Given the registered user is logged in, has previously placed bids on several items, and is currently on their profile page:

Create a section to display the items the user has bid on.

#### Won Items
Given the registered user is logged in, placed the highest bid on several items that are no longer active, and is currently on their profile page:

Create a section to display the items they have won. This is items that are no longer active (end date is before today) and the bid placed on the item is the highest of all the bidders.

## Conclusion
Part-3 wraps up the assessment.  If you haven't already done so, commit your changes.  Please wait until the end of the assessment period to submit your solution.
