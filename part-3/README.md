# Part 3: Build a CRUD App

## Summary
In Part 3 of the assessment, we'll demonstrate our proficiency in building Sinatra applications: user authentication, associations, validations, controllers, views, etc. Even a little bit of CSS.

### Site Overview
We'll be building a simplified version of a blind auction siteâ€”in a blind auction, bidders do not see how much other bidders have bid.

The required functionality of the site will be described in more detail in the *Releases* section, but here's a basic overview.

**Unregistered Users**
- Register a new account.
- Browse available items.

**Registered Users**
- Sign in and out
- List items.
- Browse available items.
- Bid on available items that other users have listed.
- Have a profile showing their listing and bidding activity.

### Provided Code
For this part of the assessment, you are provided with a Sinatra skeleton.  All but one of the migrations have been provided for you.  Some empty models have also been provided, but you will need to create another.

### Completing the App
Complete as much of this CRUD app as possible in the time allowed.  If time is running out and it looks like the app will not be completed, continue to work through the releases in order and complete as much as possible. Be sure to ask questions, if you find yourself stuck.

## Releases
### Pre-release:  Setup
We'll need to make sure that everything is set up before we begin working on the application.  From the command line, navigate to the `part-3` directory of the phase 2 assessment.  Once there, run ...

0. `$ brew update && brew install chromedriver`
0. `$ bundle`
0. `$ bundle exec rake db:create`

### Release 0: Add Model and Migration
Create both an empty `User` model and a migration to create the corresponding users table. You will need to add authentication for users later, what columns will you need to support this feature? If you are not sure, take a look at the validation section and corresponding tests.

0. `$ bundle exec rake db:migrate`
0. `$ bundle exec rake db:migrate RACK_ENV=test`

### Release 1: Associations
We will be working with four models: `Auction`, `Bid`, `Item`, and `User`.  Create the associations between the models based on the following descriptions.  It might be beneficial to create a visual representation of the database schema, based on the migrations.

**Bid**
- `bid.auction` returns the auction in which the bid was placed.
- `bid.bidder` returns the user who placed the bid.

**Auction**
- `auction.bids` returns the bids placed for the auction.
- `auction.bidders` returns the users who have bid in the auction.
- `auction.item` returns the item listed in the auction.
- `auction.lister` returns the user who created the auction

**Item**
- `item.auction` returns the auction in which the item is listed.

**User**
- `user.listed_auctions` returns the auctions created by the user.
- `user.bids` returns the bids the user has placed
- `user.bid_in_auctions` returns the auctions for which the user has placed a bid

### Release 2: Additional Model Behaviors
Once the associations have been written, let's add some additional behaviors to our models.  Some of the behaviors will be for the class itself (e.g., `Auction`) while others will be for instances (e.g., `user`). 

**Auction Class**
- `Auction.completed` returns all the auctions with end dates earlier than today's date.
- `Auction.live` returns all the auctions with start dates earlier than or equal to today's date and end dates later than or equal to today's date.
- `Auction.scheduled` returns all the auctions with start dates after today's date.

**User Instances**
- `user.completed_listed_auctions` returns the auctions created by the user that have ended.
- `user.live_listed_auctions` returns the auctions created by the user that are currently running.
- `user.scheduled_listed_auctions` returns the auctions created by the user that have yet to begin.

### Release 3: Model Validations
We want to validate our models before attempting to write to the database.  Add validations to the models, according to the following descriptions.

**Auction**
- An auction's item must exist.
- An auction's lister must exist.
- An auction must have a start date.
- An auction must have an end date.
- An auction's end date must be later than its start date.

**Bid**
- A bid's auction must exist.
- A bid's bidder must exist.
- A bid must have an amount.
- A user can have only one bid per auction.
- A user cannot bid in an auction they created.

**User**
- A user must have a username.
- A user must have a unique username.


### Release 4: User Authentication
We'll begin building the interface for our application by creating views around user sign up, sign in, and sign out.

**Sign up**
- Users can create a new account for our site.
  - If sign up is successful, the user is taken to their profile page.
  - If sign up fails, the user is taken back to the sign up page and given information about what went wrong.

**Sign in**
- Users with accounts can sign into their accounts.
  - If sign in is successful, the user is taken to their profile page.
  - If sign in fails, the user is taken back to the sign in page and given information about what went wrong.

**Sign out**
- After signing in, users can sign out.

### Release 5: CRUD Auctions and Items
Now we'll add some CRUD functionality around auctions and their items.  Users create auctions to sell items.  There's no reason to create an item without an auction.  But, remember the validation that an auction's item must exist.

**Auctions**
- Users can create auctions.
- Users can edit auctions.
- Users can delete auctions.

**Items**
- Users can create items.
- Users can edit items.

### Release 6:  Auction Pages and Layout
Let's add some pages for viewing auctions.  We'll make a page to display a single auction and a page where all the auctions are listed.  While we're at it, let's do some work on the general layout of our site.

**Individual Auctions and Layout**
- Create a page showing an individual auction.  The page should look similar to the [mockup](mockup-auction.png).


**All Auctions**
- Create a page showing a list of all live auctions.


### Release 7: CRUD Bids
Let's add the functionality to allow signed-in users to bid on items.

We'll modify the individual auction view page to support bidding.  If the user is not logged in, the view should remain as is.

If a user is signed in ...
  - If the user has not already bid in the auction, display a form for creating a new bid (see [mockup](mockup-auction-with-new-bid-form.png)).
  - If the user has already bid in the auction, display the value of the bid, a form for editing the bid, and a form for deleting the bid (see [mockup](mockup-auction-with-edit-and-delete-forms.png)).

### Release 8:  Profile Page
We'll now develop the view for the user profile page.  On the profile page, the user should see the auctions that they've listed:  completed, live, and scheduled auctions.  They should also see the items on which they've bid: completed and live.  Follow the [mockup](mockup-profile-page.png).

## Conclusion
Part-3 wraps up the assessment.  If you haven't already done so, commit your changes.  Please wait until the end of the assessment period to submit your solution.
